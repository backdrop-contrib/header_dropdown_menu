# Header Block Dropdown Menu

This simple module enables site administrators to select "dropdown" menu style for the header block menu.

The dropdown menu lis style approximately like the Basis theme's Header block menu, but with added dropdown functionality. If you are using a different theme, you will most likely need to override the css rules found in `header_dropdown_menu.css` for best results.

## Installation

- Install this module using the official Backdrop CMS instructions at https://backdropcms.org/guide/modules.
- Once enabled, select "Dropdown menu" under the new configuration setting "Menu style" within the Header block configuration. "Top level only" is the default provided by core.
